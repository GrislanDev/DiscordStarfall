The Market

Note: 'Gold' is the stand-in name for the currency of the Warlocks. Will come up with something better.
========================================================================================================================================================================================

Mechanical Purpose:
	- Allow players to trade
		- Players must pay a fee in Gold, fee scales up with the amount of goods being traded
			- Donations between allies don't pass through the Market and aren't taxed as such
		- Trades expire after 3 hours but can be renewed for a cost in Gold
		- All trades automatically expire at 00:00:00
	- Offer bounties (aka quests) for players to complete
		- The main way for players to earn Gold
		- Mainly focuses on attacking other players
		- Some bounty examples:
			- Control <> until <>
			- Destroy <> of <>'s troops
		- The target of a bounty, and the target's allies cannot see the offer
	- Allow players to hire saboteurs
		- Saboteurs cost Gold and carry out attacks on outposts
		- When the target learns about the sabotage only the saboteur's name is given
			- The hirer remains anonymous
			- This can cause instability and start wars if done cleverly
			- Sabotage is not an official act of war
	- Allow players to use Gold to buy information such as
		- A player's amount of Gems
		- A player's amount of Steel
		- A player's amount of Gold
		- A player's <> most recent actions
		- The organizers of the <> most recent sabotages
		- If there are any bounties on a player
		- Allies of another player
	
Lore:
In their efforts to regain power some Warlocks have decided to do business with the Factions.
They hope to destabilize the Factions through their dealings, as they know they aren't powerful
enough to carry out a head-on war. Let the Factions destroy themselves.
