TUTS - Provides explanations of topics in Starfall.

Topics:
ally, battle, outpost, resources, shards, war
=========================================================================================
ALLY:
When two factions are in an alliance they can reinforce each other's outposts and donate
to each other. Allied factions can't commit acts of war towards each other. A player can
send a request for alliance, but can't commit acts of war towards the other player until
the request is accepted, rejected, or expires. See "!tuts war" for more info.

BATTLE:
You can send troops to strike enemy outposts. Outposts can be defended by training troops
or reinforcing them (moving troops from other outposts). Striking takes 1 energy if the
outpost you send troops from is in the same Rim as the target. 1 energy is added per
extra Rim your troops must travel.

Having more troops increases the damage your strike can inflict on an enemy outpost, 
though victory isn't guaranteed. After the strike, if the outpost has no troops left your 
remaining troops will invade and claim the outpost for you. 

A strike is an act of war - see "!tuts war" for more info.

OUTPOST:
The gameplay of Starfall revolves around the control of outposts which provide the player
with different resources and advantages. Outposts can be upgraded and captured through
battle. Each outpost has a population of how many troops it can hold. 

Outposts are located in one of the five Rims of the galaxy. Distances between outposts 
determine the energy costs of striking and reinforcing outposts. 

Arks have high-populations and serve as military strongholds.
Harvesters produce Gems at a random rate for training troops.
Forges produce Steel at a constant rate for upgrading and constructing outposts.
Citadels can move between Rims and launch missiles.

RESOURCES:
Resources are obtained through controlling outposts, trade, and donations.

Steel is produced by Forges and is used to upgrade and build outposts. 
Gems are produced by Harvesters and are used to train troops.
Troops are trained with Gems and are used to attack and defend outposts.

WAR:
When two factions are at war they can't trade, request alliances, and donate to each
other. A player can send a request for peace but will not be able to commit acts of
war until the request is accepted, rejected, or expires. Commiting an act of war will
automatically reject any requests for peace.

Acts of war include: striking outposts and launching missiles
