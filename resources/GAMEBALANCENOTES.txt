Outpost upgrade costs rise rapidly, while Outpost Populations rise slower.
Assuming the cost of Troops is 5 Gems, it'd be cheaper to upgrade a level N
outpost than to invade a fully fortified level N outpost for (2 <= N <= 5).

This means player's won't get heavily involved in combat until level 6, where it's more
efficient. An outposts bounty increases constantly. Y = 5X + 20

==================================
Introduce expensive tech to try in higher levels, so players level slower
Players have a Glory count - this measures their standing
	- Instantly increased by combat 
	- Every tick players face Glory decay
		- After tick applied, add Glory for allies
			- Players have incentive to team up
		- Add Glory for value of outposts
